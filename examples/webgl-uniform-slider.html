title: WebGL GeoTIFF sea-level uniform
shortdesc: Renders a GeoTIFF with a user-interactive uniform value
docs: >
  A GeoTIFF containing an elevation model (DEM) is rendered as a hypsometric tint with a WebGL shader. The shader has an "uniform", a value which is the same for each pixel, that can be changed by the user and triggers a re-render of the whole tile source. In this case, the uniform is a sea elevation offset.
