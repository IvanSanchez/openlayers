title: Sentinel NDVI+NDWI
shortdesc: WebGL shader for NDVI & NDWI on Sentinel-2 data
docs: >
  A demo of how a GLTiles source works:

  Data from COGs (Cloud-Optimized Geotiffs) from a Sentinel-2 granule is fetched
  through instances of geotiff.js, then passed to a WebGL shader to calculate
  NDVI (shown as green) and NDWI (shown as blue).
